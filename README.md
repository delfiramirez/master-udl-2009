#Case Study

The project, and our mission, was to revitalize some outdated methods and obsolete web technologies are not standardized, which some publications departments of public universities employed.

A fresh corporate image based a palette of colours that will bring quality, serenity, empathy and joy to the interested parties to participate and attend an international approach and due to the nature and timing required by the campaign.

A complete navigation system , and one central column with an aside linkin to external modules, with objects clearly differentiated design column content main reading for easy adaptation.

There are still no tablets or reading devices out of beta, in the year 2009, so the CSS code does not provide responsivennes or other queries except those that are permitted by the regulations CSS2 standard by the W3C [ print and aural ] tailoring the visula design to mobile navigation devices like IPhone, and offering the final product, and the set of templates, look identical under different browsers and operating systems.

We wanted a unique style sheet that will validate for all browsers of the moment, and the browsers of future, obeying the criteria of web standardization proposed by the W3C, and avoiding custom hacks for each operating system, so in vogue then among developers.

Public entities precedence conservative character to the systems and computers used corporatively, so we analyze and balance between the access to students with more advanced devices than the corporate ones, and the reception and transmission of content through systems the institution, all of these avoiding attacks or vulnerabilities in access (code injection).

The development of the product branding and UI model proposed, focused both in the young audience and in the academic profile of the future users of the educational institution that commited the project.

Under the premise of using open source development for a further and smooth implementation in the CMS OpenPHP used by this public institution, we focus our work in five aspects.


1.- Visual and UI Design.

2.- Template XHTML design.

3.- PHP integration.

4.- CSS development.

5.- Testing.
