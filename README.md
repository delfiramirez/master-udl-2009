#Case Study

preface
------
The project, and our mission, was to revitalize some outdated methods and obsolete web technologies that were not standardized, and which some publications departments of public educational silos and universities made use of.

There was the need to show a unique style sheet that will validate in all browsers of the market, and look freshy in the browsers of the future, attending the criteria and guidelines of web standardization established by the W3C, also avoiding custom hacks for each operating system, so in vogue then among developers. 

There are still no tablets or reading devices out of beta in the year 2009, so the CSS code provided here does not meet the actual responsivenes neither other queries, except those that are permitted by the normative CSS 2.1 standard by the W3C-WAIG [ print and aural ].

design
------
For the development of the templates, to achieve the product branding and UI model proposed, there was the focus and the scope both in the young audience and in the academic profile of the future users of the educational institution that commited the project. 

For this, there was conceived a fresh corporate image, a retro-modern aesthetic, build upon a collection of heading background figures and an innovative smaller palette of colours, together with the use of a solid and modern tipography, adding subtle gradients and shadows, and different font sizes to better differentiate discrete areas of content bringing quality, serenity, empathy, even joy into the audicence, and optimising the choice to subscribe or to participate; following the milestones and timing required by the campaign.

There is in mind the universe of resources linked by the URIs in their representations, to have an identical look whether on different browsers and its respective operating systems.

Once tailored the UI design of the templates collection for mobile consume devices, like the Iphone, and having the final graphical assets ready, the software solution was deployed.

usability
--------
A complete navigation system, located in the header and in the footer, and one central column with an aside list linking to external modules, incorporates structural elements clearly differentiated from the main content.

Being the final client a public educational institution, the source code of the templates follow the accessibility standards and guidelines, required by law in North America and in the EMEA area.

Its structure is adapted to the benefits and need of multilanguge capabilities for metadata and representations of resources.

security
-------

It has to be noticed that public entities precedence a conservative character in the systems and computers used corporatively. 

For this reason exposed above, previous analyis and balances between the access to the application made by students who might make use of more advanced or modern devices than the corporate ones, and the reception and transmission of the content and data internally, and externally, by the systems of the institution, were done. 

All of these analysis, took in consideration and put in practice security standards, protecting possible denials, attacks or future vulnerabilities, and preserving the integrity in the use and access to the CMS system (ie: code injection).

deployment
-------

Under the choice for an open source development thre is the the premise of providing a smooth integration with the native CMS OpenPHP system.

All efforts were positively focused in the milestones of the process of development, in mastering the code, and in making possible the implementation of the final result into other CMSs.

Segmentation of the procces and work was done in

five essential aspects.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.- Visual and UI Design. [ Graphical Assets : Donâ€™t rely on colour alone,  Provide clear navigation mechanisms ]

2.- Template XHTML design. [ Prototype Modelling :  Create tables that transform gracefully. Ensure that documents are clear and simple ]

3.- PHP integration for Markdown. [ Functional deployment - Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully ]

4.- CSS development. [ Design for device independence: Screen, projector mobile and print ]

5.- Testing.


Client:  University Institution. Made with faith in the year 2009
