#Case Study

The project, and our mission, was to revitalize some outdated methods and obsolete web technologies that were not standardized, and which some publications departments of public educational silos and universities made use of.

There are still no tablets or reading devices out of beta in the year 2009, so the CSS code provided here does not meet the actual responsivennes or other queries, except those that are permitted by the regulations of the normative CSS 2.1 standard by the W3C-WAIG [ print and aural ].

We wanted to show a unique style sheet that will validate in all browsers of the market, and will look fresh in the browsers of future, obeying the criteria of web standardization proposed by the W3C, and avoiding custom hacks for each operating system, so in vogue then among developers. 

The development of the templates, the product branding and UI model proposed, had the focus and the scope both in the young audience and in the academic profile of the future users of the educational institution that commited the project.

We tailored the UI design of the templates collection the for mobile consume devices like the Iphone, and keeping in mind to present the final product, and the software solution, to have an identical look under different browsers and its operating systems.

For this, we conceived a fresh corporate image based upon an innovative palette of colours and modern tipography that will bring quality, serenity, empathy and joy to the interested audicence, helping the oneed will to participate and attend an international approach conference or studies, due to the nature and timing required by the campaign.


A complete navigation system, and one central column with an aside list linking to external modules, with its structural elements clearly differentiated from the design and column offered by the main content featured in the app.

Being the final client a public educational institution, source code accomplish the accessibility standards and its guidelines, required by law in North America and the EMEA area, and structure must follow the multilanguge capabilities needed.

It has to be noticed that public entities precedence a conservative character in the systems and computers used corporatively. For this reason, we analyze the balance between access by students with more advanced or modern devices than the corporate ones, and the reception and transmission of the content and data internally and externally by the systems of the institution. All of these analysis, avoiding attacks or future vulnerabilities in the use and access of the CMS system (ie: code injection).

Under the premise of using open source development for a further and smooth implementation in its CMS OpenPHP, we did focus our efforts and plan the development milestones, mastering the code and making possible its implementations into other CMSs.

We start to deploy and work into

five essential aspects.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.- Visual and UI Design. [ Graphical Assets : Donâ€™t rely on colour alone,  Provide clear navigation mechanisms ]

2.- Template XHTML design. [ Prototype Modelling :  Create tables that transform gracefully. Ensure that documents are clear and simple ]

3.- PHP integration for Markdown. [ Functional deployment - Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully ]

4.- CSS development. [ Design for device independence: Screen, projector mobile and print ]

5.- Testing.


Client:  University Institution. Made with faith in the year 2009
