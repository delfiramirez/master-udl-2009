#Case Study

preface
------
The project, and our mission, was to revitalize some outdated methods and obsolete web technologies that were not standardized, and which some publications departments of public educational silos and universities made use of.

There was the need to show a unique style sheet that will validate in all browsers of the market, and look freshy in the browsers of the future, attending the criteria and guidelines of web standardization established by the W3C, also avoiding custom hacks for each operating system, so in vogue then among developers. 

There are still no tablets or reading devices out of beta in the year 2009, so the CSS code provided here does not meet the actual responsivenes neither other queries, except those that are permitted by the normative CSS 2.1 standard by the W3C-WAIG [ print and aural ].

design
------
For the development of the templates, to achieve the product branding and UI model proposed, there was the focus and the scope both in the young audience and in the academic profile of the future users of the educational institution that commited the project. We have also in mind the universe of resources linked by the URIs in their representations.

Tailored the UI design of the templates collection for mobile consume devices like the Iphone, and keeping in mind the final product, the software solution was deployed, to have an identical suave look under different browsers and its respective operating systems.

For this, there was conceived a fresh corporate image based upon a collection of figures and an innovative palette of colours and modern tipography that will bring quality, serenity, empathy and joy to the interested audicence, helping the will to participate and attend to an international approach ourse or studies, due to the nature and timing required by the campaign.

usability
--------
A complete navigation system, and one central column with an aside list linking to external modules, with its structural elements clearly differentiated from the design and column offered by the main content featured in the app.

Being the final client a public educational institution, source code of the templates have accessibility standards . its guidelines, required by law in North America and the EMEA area, and structure must follow the multilanguge capabilities needed using metadata and representations of resources.

security
-------

It has to be noticed that public entities precedence a conservative character in the systems and computers used corporatively. For this reason, we analyze the balance between access by students with more advanced or modern devices than the corporate ones, and the reception and transmission of the content and data internally and externally by the systems of the institution. 

All of these analysis, take in considertion security standards, protecting attacks or future vulnerabilities in the use and access to the CMS system (ie: code injection).

deployment
-------

Under the premise of using open source development for a further and smooth implementation in its CMS OpenPHP, efforts were placed into planning the development milestones, mastering the code, and making possible its implementations into other CMSs.

We start to deploy and work into

five essential aspects.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.- Visual and UI Design. [ Graphical Assets : Donâ€™t rely on colour alone,  Provide clear navigation mechanisms ]

2.- Template XHTML design. [ Prototype Modelling :  Create tables that transform gracefully. Ensure that documents are clear and simple ]

3.- PHP integration for Markdown. [ Functional deployment - Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully ]

4.- CSS development. [ Design for device independence: Screen, projector mobile and print ]

5.- Testing.


Client:  University Institution. Made with faith in the year 2009
